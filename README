Article APIs

article-rewriter.php - Takes an article as a GET variable, rewrites it so that it appears to be unique content using thesaurus definitions, and echoes the output to the webpage.

article-simplifier.php - Basically, reverses what article-rewriter.php does.

These were both used as part of a Wordpress autoblog extension I built. Enjoy.
